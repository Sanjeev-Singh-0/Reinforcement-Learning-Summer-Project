## Introduction to the Problem

Imagine a grid of size n x m in which a robot has to traverse from a set start point to a set end point. However within the grid there are "holes" which the robot should avoid falling into. The aim is for the robot to learn the optimal path from start to end.

## Methods for solving the problem

There are two various methods which have been implemented to solve this problem:
* Q - Learning algorithm, making use of a Q Table
* Deep Q Learning, making use of a deep Q network
